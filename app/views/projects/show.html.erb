      <p>
        It looks like we're successfully tracking data for your project.
      </p>

      <p>
        To explore your data, you just need to visit your web site while logged into Landmark.
        Just click on the Landmark icon in the lower left hand corner of your site to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don't want to see the Landmark icon on your site any more then just log out of Landmark.
        And don't worry -- visitors to your site won't see the Landmark icon.
        Just you.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        It doesn't look like you have any data logged with your project just yet.
        Don't worry.
        It's easy to get started.
        Just copy and paste this JavaScript on to your web page:
      </p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="//landmark.io/landmark.js"
  data-api-key="<%= @project.api_key %>"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

      <p>
        After adding that, just reload your web page and you should see your data available in Landmark immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        See our <%= link_to('documentation page', page_path("help")) %> for help on user identification, user traits and action properties.
      </p>
    <% end %>
