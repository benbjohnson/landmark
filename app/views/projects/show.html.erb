        It looks like we're successfully tracking data for your project.

        It doesn't look like you have any data logged with your project just yet.
        Don't worry.
        It's easy to get started.
        Just copy and paste this JavaScript on to your web page:
      </p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="//landmark.io/landmark.js"
  data-api-key="<%= @project.api_key %>"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

      <p>
        After adding that, just reload your web page and you should see your data available in Landmark immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        See our <%= link_to('documentation page', page_path("help")) %> for help on user identification, user traits and action properties.
      </p>
    <% end %>
  </div>
